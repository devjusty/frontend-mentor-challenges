## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided for a simple profile card component, with some responsive background images.

### Screenshot

![Profile Card Screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Positioning the background images could have also been done with `linear-gradient()` functions in CSS, but it was tricky to make them responsive in the way that I wanted. I could have also used `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and may update the implementation to move them to that.
