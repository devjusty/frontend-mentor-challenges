## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Positioning the background images could have also been done with `linear-gradient()` functions in CSS, but it was tricky to make them responsive in the way that I wanted. I could have also used `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and may update the implementation to move them to that.

### Useful resources
